# Genetic Algorithms in Python Workshop

## Overview
This repository contains two distinct examples of solving classic optimization problems using genetic algorithms in Python. These examples are part of a workshop designed to teach the principles and implementation of genetic algorithms.

## Examples

### 1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Santa Claus needs to find the shortest route to deliver gifts worldwide. This example demonstrates how to solve the TSP using a genetic algorithm.

- **Data**: `TSP-Solver/data/santaDistance01.json`

### 2. Knapsack Problem
Santa must select the most optimal assortment of gifts subject to weight constraints. This example illustrates the application of a genetic algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem.
